# Shutdown or Switch widget for KDE 5

Plasma 5 widget for quick accessing the leave options (shutdown, reboot, suspend, logout) or to quickly switch between different users.

This is a customized version of the widget [user switcher](https://github.com/KDE/kdeplasma-addons/tree/master/applets/userswitcher) created by Kai Uwe Broulik.

## TODO
